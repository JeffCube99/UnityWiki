Quick Start
===========

The process of downloading an asset from the Unity asset store is as follows:

#.  Visit the asset store at https://assetstore.unity.com/
#.  Sign In
#.  On the asset page that you want to download click the **Add to My Assets** button and accept the agreement.
#.  In the unity editor. Go to **Window > Package Manager**
#.  In the Packages dropdown select **My Assets**. Then search for the asset you downloaded.
#.  Once you have selected your package click **Download** (Appears only you do not have the assets downloaded already)
    and then click **Import**.
#.  Select whatever assets from the package you need. By default Unity selects all assets for download.
