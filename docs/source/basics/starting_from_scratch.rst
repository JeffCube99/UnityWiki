Quick Guide
===========

To get a project up and running quickly, follow these steps:

#.  Download `Unity Hub <https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download>`_
#.  Inside Unity Hub, go to the installs tab on the left sidebar and click the "Add" button.
#.  Select the version of unity you want to install.
#.  Next it will ask you to add modules to your install. If you do not have it already
    install Microsoft Visual Studio. Additionally install any build support you want.

..  note::

    Sometimes your download will not finish and Unity will say something like

    ..  error::

        Installation Failed
        Something went wring installing Unity <version number>

    Simply close out the error message and try the install again. If the error persists
    then try restarting your computer and try the installation again.

    If all else fails you need to install manually. Go to the
    `Unity download archive <https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive>`_ and install
    your specific version there. To do this:

    #.  Select your specific version
    #.  Choose the unity installer option
    #.  Once the UnityDownloadAssistant downloads run the file.
    #.  Complete the installation through the download assistant and install any build
        support you want when the option is presented.
    #.  By default unity will install to the location ``C:\Program Files\Unity <version>``
    #.  After Unity has been installed you can add it to unity hub by going to the
        installs tab on the left sidebar, click the "Locate" button, and select the editor
        file at ``C:\Program Files\Unity <version>\Editor\Unity``

#.  Next go to the Projects tab and click the dropdown arrow next to the "New" button. From there
    select the version you want to start a new project in.
#.  From here you can choose from a range of templates. Note that it is suggested to use the Universal
    Render Pipeline template as it allows you to quickly and easily create optimized graphics for a range
    of platforms. After selecting the project name and location you can can add the project and the editor will open.
