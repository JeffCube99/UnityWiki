Example taken from `Best Practices for fast game design in Unity - Unite LA <https://youtu.be/NU29QKag8a0?t=1843>`_

Character has a machine gun that shoots bullets at enemies. The bullets disappear when they hit an enemy
and an enemy dies when it gets hit with enough bullets.

Some Improvements:

*   Instead of sphere bullets make them appear like white hot projectiles
*   Add explosions when the bullet connects against the enemy
*   Add bullet shells exiting the gun
*   Add recoil to the gun so you see it moving when you shoot
*   Add muzzle flash
*   Add vibrations to phone when you shoot (haptic feedback)
*   Add death animation explosion to enemy
*   Add camera shake
*   Add dynamic lighting emitted from gun when firing
*   Add freeze frames on kill
*   Add flash highlight to screen when explosion happens.
*   Add bullet spread so projectiles firing everywhere.
*   Add slow motion when enemy dies.
