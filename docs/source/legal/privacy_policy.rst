Creating a Privacy Policy
#########################

When releasing your app you will have to provide a privacy policy to the app store you are releasing to. Below
are some of the steps I took to create the privacy policy for my app.

#.  Visit https://unity.com/legal/developer-privacy-policy-faq . On this webpage Unity provides some guidance for
    Unity Developers about what information you should ad to your privacy policy given the services you incorporate
    into your app.
#.  Visit https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy . On this page are links to privacy policies that users can use
    if the policies apply to them
#.  Visit https://docs.unity.com/ads/en-us/manual/ImplementingDataPrivacy if you use unity ads.
    They will provide information on what kinds of data is collected for different app store platforms.
#.  Visit https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/ to generate a privacy policy from a template.
#.  Use https://sites.google.com/ to host your privacy policy page.

Implementing Privacy Policy on Apple App Store
##############################################

#.  Log into https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/
#.  Select your app
#.  Go to the **App Privacy** section and start the setup
#.  During setup apple will survey you about the data your collect. I used uniity ads so i
    visited https://docs.unity.com/ads/en-us/manual/ApplePrivacySurvey to help me answer the questions about the data
    that is collected. Once the survey is complete click on each of the elements that unity collects to provide
    more information that is also located on https://docs.unity.com/ads/en-us/manual/ApplePrivacySurvey.
#.  Go to https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/ to generate the text of your privacy policy by
    providing all relevant information
#.  Copy and paste the privacy policy text onto a Blank site using https://sites.google.com/ . Publish the website and you
    are done.

Implementing Privacy Policy on Google Play Console
##################################################

#.  Log into https://play.google.com/console
#.  Select your app
#.  On your dashboard under the app setup checklist, one of the steps to getting your app ready for review is to provide a privacy policy URL.
#.  Like in the Apple App Store Example above, go to https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/ to generate the text of your privacy policy by
    providing all relevant information
#.  Copy and paste the privacy policy text onto a Blank site using https://sites.google.com/ . Publish the website and you
    are done.
#.  In another section of the app setup checklist under data safety, google will ask you survey questions about what data you collect. For this go to https://docs.unity.com/ads/en-us/manual/GoogleDataSafety
    to help you answer these questions. Additionally. In one section gooogle asks that you "Add a link that users can use to request that their data is deleted".
    For this we supply a link to unity's privacy policy (https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy)
    since it contains a section about requests for user data deletion.
