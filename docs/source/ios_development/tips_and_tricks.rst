Configuring Game Orientation
============================

If you want to force your iOS game to remain in landscape mode or portrait mode or some combination of the two
do the following:

#.  Go to **Edit > Project Settings** and select the **Player** column.
#.  Select the **iOS** tab from the row of platforms.
#.  Expand the section titled **Resolution and Presentation**.

    *   If you want to restrict the user to a single orientation: Under the **Default Orientation** dropdown
        select the preferred Landscape / Portrait setting. Under **Allowed Orientations for Auto Rotation**
    *   If you want to allow the user to orient the game in multiple ways: Under the **Default Orientation** dropdown
        select **Auto Rotation**. Then under **Allowed Orientations for Auto Rotation** select the checkboxes next to the
        orientations you wish to enable.
