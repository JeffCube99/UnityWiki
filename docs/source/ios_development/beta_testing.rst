Beta Testing
############

The `Apple App Store Guidelines <https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#beta-testing>`_ explicitly
state that "Demos, betas, and trial versions of your app don't belong on the App Store". Instead they refer
developers looking to test their apps to Apple's `TestFlight <https://developer.apple.com/testflight/>`_ Service.
