    your best bet is to apply a frictionaless material to the character's collider.

For 2D Friction
---------------

#.  Inside your project window create a new physics material by right clicking and selecting
    **Create > 2D > Physics Material 2D**.
#.  Inside the material set bounciness to 0 and Friction to 0
#.  Inside your character's collider, set the physics material to the one you just created. Additionally
